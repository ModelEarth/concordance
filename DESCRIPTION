Description: A set of utilities for matching products in different
	     classification codes used in international trade
	     research. It supports concordance between the Harmonized
	     System (HS0, HS1, HS2, HS3, HS4, HS5, HS combined), the Standard 
	     International Trade Classification (SITC1, SITC2, SITC3, SITC4), 
	     the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS 2002, 2007, 
	     2012, 2017, combined), as well as the Broad Economic Categories (BEC), 
	     the International Standard of Industrial Classification (ISIC2, ISIC3, 
	     ISIC3.1, ISIC4), and the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). It 
	     also provides code nomenclature/descriptions look-up, product code 
	     look-up based on user-specified keywords, Rauch classification look-up 
	     (via concordance to SITC2), trade elasticity look-up (via concordance 
	     to HS0 or SITC3 codes), upstreamness/downstreamness look-up (via 
	     concordance to ISIC3 and NAICS codes), and intermediateness look-up (via product 
	     descriptions).
